            The movie poster website is a website that curates and archives
            movie posters for poster lovers worldwide! Here we have a wide
            varity of movie poster all the way from Russia and back and that
            span from the inception of the movie poster to today. We are
            students at KEA â€“ Copenhagen School of Design and Technology and
            this website of ours is a part of a group project, where we as a
            team had to find a common interest and design and code a website
            about that interest. We all found out that we had a common passion
            for movies, more specifically movie posters.
